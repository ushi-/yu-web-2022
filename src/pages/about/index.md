  interactions.

### I currently work at [Takram](https://www.takram.com), a design innovation firm based in Tokyo, London and New York as one of the directors.

### Driven by both love and concern in emerging technologies and their influence on us, my interaction design practice tends to straddle multiple stages of product development; from concept through prototyping to real-world deployment. By doing so, I facilitate in-depth understanding of the implication of emerging technologies and encourage better-informed decision-making on our future.

#### What I do

- Developing future visions that are not necessarily shiny but more compelling,
- Creating prototypes that turn future visions into tangible experiences, and
- Designing interactions of new products and services
